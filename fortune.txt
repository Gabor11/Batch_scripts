"A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of
being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite series of
incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague
assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents
and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of
dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of
annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was
unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place."

Creation science has not entered the curriculum for a reason so simple	
and so basic that we often forget to mention it: because it is false, and	
because good teachers understand exactly why it is false. What could be	
more destructive of that most fragile yet most precious commodity in our	
entire intellectual heritage - good teaching - than a bill forcing	
honorable teachers to sully their sacred trust by granting equal treatment	
to a doctrine not only known to be false, but calculated to undermine any	
general understanding of science as an enterprise?

claim "I've got a deep semantic theory", they are truly blessed.

The brain is a beautifully engineered get-out-of-the-way machine that	
constantly scans the environment for things out of whose way it should	
right now get. That's what brains did for several hundred million years -	
and then, just a few million years ago, the mammalian brain learned a new	
trick: to predict the timing and location of dangers before they actually	
happened.	
	
Our ability to duck that which is not yet coming is one of the brain's most	
stunning innovations, and we wouldn't have dental floss or 401(k) plans	
without it. But this innovation is in the early stages of development. The	
application that allows us to respond to visible baseballs is ancient and	
reliable, but the add-on utility that allows us to respond to threats that	
loom in an unseen future is still in beta testing.

As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't	
as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be

my own programs.

component does, although it should require less time, for more complete and	
efficient test cases will usually be available.

As to Jesus of Nazareth...I think the system of Morals and his Religion,

At the heart of science is an essential tension between two seemingly	
contradictory attitudes - an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre	
or counterintuitive they may be, and the most ruthless skeptical scrutiny	
of all ideas, old and new. This is how deep truths are winnowed from deep	
nonsense. Of course, scientists make mistakes in trying to understand the	
world, but there is a built-in error-correcting mechanism: The collective	
enterprise of creative thinking and skeptical thinking together keeps the	
field on track.

Do not allow this language (Ada) in its present state to be used in	
applications where reliability is critical, i.e., nuclear power stations,	
cruise missiles, early warning systems, anti-ballistic missle defense	
systems. The next rocket to go astray as a result of a programming language	
error may not be an exploratory space rocket on a harmless trip to Venus:	
It may be a nuclear warhead exploding over one of our cities. An unreliable	
programming language generating unreliable programs constitutes a far	
greater risk to our environment and to our society than unsafe cars, toxic	
pesticides, or accidents at nuclear power stations.

to be much less disruptive than a constant rippling and trembling.

Every Horse has an Infinite Number of Legs (proof by intimidation):	
Horses have an even number of legs. Behind they have two legs, and in	
front they have fore-legs. This makes six legs, which is certainly an	
odd number of legs for a horse. But the only number that is both even	
and odd is infinity. Therefore, horses have an infinite number of	
legs. Now to show this for the general case, suppose that somewhere,	
there is a horse that has a finite number of legs. But that is a horse	
of another color, and by the [above] lemma ["All horses are the same	
color"], that does not exist.

Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired

genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way	
of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is

Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of confusion and	
bamboozle requires intelligence, vigilance, dedication and courage. But if we

for grabs by the next charlatan who comes along.

For the politicians this was never about how efficient they could make	
things happen or how to solve a problem, it is about the *appearance* of	
efficiency, or problem solving. My observation is that most politicians	
think more like sales people than technicians, and are about as clueful.	
Which means, unless the politicians change the way they think, discussion	
about how to use *them* to go about really solving these problems would be	
like asking a booth babe to write a kernel module.

Frobnicate, v.:	
        To manipulate or adjust, to tweak. Derived from FROBNITZ.	
Usually abbreviated to FROB. Thus one has the saying "to frob a	
frob". See TWEAK and TWIDDLE. Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and TWEAK	
sometimes connote points along a continuum. FROB connotes aimless	
manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross manipulation, often a coarse	
search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes fine-tuning. If someone is	
turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it	
he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the	
screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it because	
turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.

Human cardiac catheterization was introduced by Werner Forssman in 1929.	
Ignoring his department chief, and tying his assistant to an operating	
table to prevent his interference, he placed a uretheral catheter into a

##1001	
I'm an evolutionist because I judge the evidence for the unity of life by	
common descent over billions of years to be overwhelming, not so that I can	
cheat on my wife or kick the cat with impunity. I live in no hope of heaven	
or fear of hell, but like most of my fellow Americans of all religious	
persuasions, I try to live a decent life. Folks like Tom DeLay just can't	
get it through their heads that a person can choose to live ethically	
because civilized life requires doing unto others as you would have them do	
unto you.

I am a member of a party of one, and I live in an age of fear. Nothing	
lately has unsettled my party and raised my fears so much as your	
editorial, on Thanksgiving Day, suggesting that employees should be

inconsistent with our constitutional theory and has been stubbornly opposed	
by watchful men since the early days of the Republic.

I am, in point of fact, a particularly haughty and exclusive person, of	
pre-Adamite ancestral descent. You will understand this when I tell you	
that I can trace my ancestry back to a protoplasmal primordial atomic

I cannot affirm God if I fail to affirm man. Therefore, I affirm both.

I don't like spreading rumors, but what else can you do with them?	
##1031	
I dread success. To have succeeded is to have finished one's business

I put the shotgun in an Adidas bag and padded it out with four pairs of tennis	
socks, not my style at all, but that was what I was aiming for: If they think	
you're crude, go technical; if they think you're technical, go crude. I'm a

though, you have to be pretty technical before you can even aspire to	
crudeness.

I simply try to aid in letting the light of historical truth into that decaying

I was in this prematurely air conditioned supermarket and there were all

avoiding the beach.

I went on to test the program in every way I could devise. I strained	
it to expose its weaknesses. I ran it for high-mass stars and low-mass	
stars, for stars born exceedingly hot and those born relatively cold.	
I ran it assuming the superfluid currents beneath the crust to be	
absent - not because I wanted to know the answer, but because I had	
developed an intuitive feel for the answer in this particular case.	
Finally I got a run in which the computer showed the pulsar's	
temperature to be less than absolute zero. I had found an error. I	
chased down the error and fixed it. Now I had improved the program to	
the point where it would not run at all.

Men ought to know that from the brain and from the brain only arise our	
pleasures, joys, laughter, and jests as well as our sorrows, pains, griefs	
and tears. ... It is the same thing which makes us mad or delirious, inspires	
us with dread and fear, whether by night or by day, brings us sleeplessness,	
inopportune mistakes, aimless anxieties, absent-mindedness and acts that are	
contrary to habit...

##1536	
Millions of sensible people are too high-minded to concede that politics is	
almost always the choice of the lesser evil. "Tweedledum and Tweedledee,"	
they say, "I will not vote." Having abstained, they are presented with a	
President who appoints the people who are going to rummage around in their	
lives for the next four years. Consider all the people who sat home in a	
stew in 1968 rather than vote for Hubert Humphrey. They showed Humphrey.	
Those people who taught Hubert Humphrey a lesson will still be enjoying the	
Nixon Supreme Court when Tricia and Julie begin to find silver threads

##1568	
My own life has been spent chronicling the rise and fall of human systems,	
and I am convinced that we are terribly vulnerable.... We should be	
reluctant to turn back upon the frontier of this epoch. Space is	
indifferent to what we do; it has no feeling, no design, no interest in	
whether or not we grapple with it. But we cannot be indifferent to space,	
because the grand, slow march of intelligence has brought us, in our	
generation, to a point from which we can explore and understand and utilize	
it. To turn back now would be to deny our history, our capabilities.

back? Overlay three different types of variable on the same memory

That is the key to history. Terrific energy is expended - civilizations	
are built up - excellent institutions devised; but each time something	
goes wrong. Some fatal flaw always brings the selfish and cruel people to

machine conks. It seems to start up all right and runs a few yards, and	
then it breaks down.

The USA is so enormous, and so numerous are its schools, colleges and

The reason ESP, for example, is not considered a viable topic in	
contemporary psychology is simply that its investigation has not proven	
fruitful...After more than 70 years of study, there still does not exist	
one example of an ESP phenomenon that is replicable under controlled	
conditions. This simple but basic scientific criterion has not been met	
despite dozens of studies conducted over many decades... It is for this	
reason alone that the topic is now of little interest to psychology... In	
short, there is no demonstrated phenomenon that needs explanation.

The tar pit of software engineering will continue to be sticky for a long time	
to come. One can expect the human race to continue attempting systems just	
within or just beyond our reach; and software systems are perhaps the most	
intricate and complex of man's handiworks. The management of this complex	
craft will demand our best use of new languages and systems, our best	
adaptation of proven engineering management methods, liberal doses of common	
sense, and ... humility to recognize our fallibility and limitations.

The vigor of civilized societies is preserved by the widespread sense that	
high aims are worth-while. Vigorous societies harbor a certain	
extravagance of objectives, so that men wander beyond the safe provision of

an accomplishment, the Peace brought by something worth-while.

Writing programs needs genius to save the last order or the last millisecond.	
It is great fun, but it is a young man's game. You start it with great	
enthusiasm when you first start programming, but after ten years you get a	
bit bored with it, and then you turn to automatic-programming languages and	
use them because they enable you to get to the heart of the problem that you	
want to do, instead of having to concentrate on the mechanics of getting the	
program going as fast as you possibly can, which is really nothing more than	
doing a sort of crossword puzzle.

My guess is that well over eighty per cent of the human race goes through	
life without ever having a single original thought. That is to say, they	
never think anything that has not been thought before, and by thousands. A	
society made up of individuals who were all capable of original thought	
would probably be unendurable. The pressure of ideas would simply drive it	
frantic.

The great artists of the world are never Puritans, and seldom even	
ordinarily respectable. No virtuous man-that is, virtuous in the YMCA	
sense-has ever painted a picture worth looking at, or written a symphony	
worth hearing, or a book worth reading, and it is highly improbable that	
the thing has ever been done by a virtuous woman.	
        - H.L. Mencken, Prejudices, 1919.	
##2589	
The highfalutin aims of democracy, whether real or imaginary, are always	
assumed to be identical with its achievements. This, of course, is sheer	
hallucination. Not one of those aims, not even the aim of giving every	
adult a vote, has been realized. It has no more made men wise and free than	
Christianity has made them good.

The most costly of all follies is to believe passionately in the palpably not	
true. It is the chief occupation of mankind.

##2591	
The notion that science does not concern itself with first causes-that	
it leaves the field to theology or metaphysics, and confines itself to mere	
effects-this notion has no support in the plain facts. If it could,	
science would explain the origin of life on earth at once - and there is	
every reason to believe that it will do so on some not too remote tomorrow.	
To argue that gaps in knowledge which will confront the seeker must be	
filled, not by patient inquiry, but by intuition or revelation, is simply	
to give ignorance a gratuitous and preposterous dignity....	
        - H. L. Mencken, 1930

The one permanent emotion of the inferior man is fear-fear of the unknown,	
the complex, the inexplicable. What he wants beyond everything else is safety.	
        - H.L. Mencken, Prejudices, 1920.	
##2593	
The truth is that Christian theology, like every other theology, is not only	
opposed to the scientific spirit; it is also opposed to all other attempts	
at rational thinking. Not by accident does Genesis 3 make the father of	
knowledge a serpent - slimy, sneaking and abominable. Since the earliest	
days the church as an organization has thrown itself violently against every	
effort to liberate the body and mind of man. It has been, at all times and	
everywhere, the habitual and incorrigible defender of bad governments, bad	
laws, bad social theories, bad institutions. It was, for centuries, an	
apologist for slavery, as it was the apologist for the divine right of kings.	
        - H. L. Mencken	
##2594	
The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence	
clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of	
hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.

##2595	
There is, in fact, no reason to believe that any given natural phenomenon,	
however marvelous it may seem today, will remain forever inexplicable.	
Soon or late the laws governing the production of life itself will be	
discovered in the laboratory, and man may set up business as a creator on	
his own account. The thing, indeed, is not only conceivable; it is even	
highly probable.

##2596	
To sum up: 1. The cosmos is a gigantic fly-wheel making 10,000 revolutions	
a minute. 2. Man is a sick fly taking a dizzy ride on it. 3. Religion is the	
theory that the wheel was designed and set spinning to give him the ride.	
        - H. L. Mencken, Coda from "Smart Set", 1920	
##2597	
When a candidate for public office faces the voters he does not face men of	
sense; he faces a mob of men whose chief distinguishing mark is the fact that	
they are quite incapable of weighing ideas, or even of comprehending any save	
the most elemental — men whose whole thinking is done in terms of emotion, and	
whose dominant emotion is dread of what they cannot understand. So confronted,	
the candidate must either bark with the pack or be lost... All the odds are on	
the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre — the man who can	
most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The	
Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected,	
the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We	
move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of	
the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be	
adorned by a downright moron.

You must, therefore, hasten, not only because you are every day nearer to

##2605	
Never esteem of anything as profitable, which shell ever constrain thee to

##2612	
Everything which is in any way beautiful is beautiful in itself, and	
terminates in itself, not having praise as part of itself. Neither worse,	
then, nor better is a thing made by being praised.	
        - Marcus Aurelius, "The Meditations", Book IV	
##2613	
The words which were formerly familiar are now antiquated: so also the names	
of those who were famed of old, are now in a manner antiquated... For all	
things soon pass away and become a mere tale, and complete oblivion soon

Time is like a river made up of the events which happen, and a violent stream;

Let not future things disturb you, for you will come to them, if it shall be

The essence of Christianity is told to us in the Garden of Eden history.	
The fruit that was forbidden was on the Tree of Knowledge. The subtext is,

[The Weather Channel] is the most watched cable channel in America. I'll	
repeat that. It is the most watched cable channel in America. They were	
worried about the terrorists immobilizing us, and a portion of our	
countrymen watch weather. 'Kay, you don't get any more immobile than	
that... unless you're in a goddamn coma. That means you're saying, "I'd go

What is so unnerving about the candidacy of Sarah Palin is the degree to which	
she represents—and her supporters celebrate—the joyful marriage of confidence	
and ignorance . . . Ask yourself: how has "elitism" become a bad word in	
American politics? There is simply no other walk of life in which extraordinary	
talent and rigorous training are denigrated. We want elite pilots to fly our	
planes, elite troops to undertake our most critical missions, elite athletes to	
represent us in competition and elite scientists to devote the most productive	
years of their lives to curing our diseases. And yet, when it comes time to	
vest people with even greater responsibilities, we consider it a virtue to shun	
any and all standards of excellence. When it comes to choosing the people whose	
thoughts and actions will decide the fates of millions, then we suddenly want	
someone just like us, someone fit to have a beer with, someone down-to-earth—in	
fact, almost anyone, provided that he or she doesn't seem too intelligent or	
well educated.

Water is two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen. This seems as value-free an	
utterance as human beings ever make. But what do we do when someone doubts the	
truth of this proposition? Ok, all we can do is appeal to scientific values.	
The value of understanding the world. The value of evidence. The value of	
logical consistency. What if someone says, “Well, that’s not how I choose to	
think about water. Ok, what can we say to such a person? Ok, all we can do is	
appeal to scientific values. And if he doesn’t share those values, the	
conversation is over. Ok, if someone doesn’t value evidence, what evidence are	
you going to provide to prove that they should value it? If someone doesn’t	
value logic, what logical argument could you provide to show the importance of	
logic?

Bypasses are devices that allow some people to dash from point A to point B	
very fast while other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People

what's so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to	
get there and what's so great about point B that so many people from point A

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western

These people live again in print as intensely as when their images were

When I'm ready to make a photograph, I think I quite obviously see in my minds

extracted from without.

We’ve bought into the idea that education is about training and	
success, defined monetarily, rather than learning to think critically	
and to challenge. We should not forget that the true purpose of education	
is to make minds, not careers. A culture that does not grasp the vital	
interplay between morality and power, which mistakes management techniques	
for wisdom, which fails to understand that the measure of a civilization	
is its compassion, not its speed or ability to consume, condemns itself	
to death.

Inverted totalitarianism, unlike classical totalitarianism, does not

Washington has become our Versailles. We are ruled, entertained,	
and informed by courtiers-and the media has evolved into a class of	
courtiers. The Democrats, like the Republicans, are mostly courtiers. Our	
pundits and experts, at least those with prominent public platforms,	
are courtiers. We are captivated by the hollow stagecraft of political	
theater as we are ruthlessly stripped of power. It is smoke and mirrors,	
tricks and con games, and the purpose behind it is deception.

The split in America, rather than simply economic, is between those who

##2799	
Hope has a cost. Hope is not comfortable or easy. Hope requires personal	
risk. It is not about the right attitude. Hope is not about peace of	
mind. Hope is action. Hope is doing something. The more futile, the more	
useless, the more irrelevant and incomprehensible an act of rebellion is,	
the vaster and more potent hope becomes.  Hope never makes sense. Hope is	
weak, unorganized and absurd. Hope, which is always nonviolent, exposes in	
its powerlessness, the lies, fraud and coercion employed by the state. Hope	
knows that an injustice visited on our neighbor is an injustice visited on	
all of us. Hope posits that people are drawn to the good by the good. This	
is the secret of hope's power. Hope demands for others what we demand for	
ourselves. Hope does not separate us from them. Hope sees in our enemy	
our own face.
